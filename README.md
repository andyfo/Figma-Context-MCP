## WP Godmode fork

**This is WP Godmode's fork of [Framelink MCP for Figma](https://github.com/GLips/Figma-Context-MCP), released as `godmode-figma-mcp`.** Everything below the divider is upstream's README.

What's different from upstream (based on upstream `c083d65`: v0.13.2 plus one fix):

- **Dev Mode annotations** on the layers they're attached to (upstream PR [#425](https://github.com/GLips/Figma-Context-MCP/pull/425), cherry-picked).
- **Ready for dev status** ("Ready for dev" / "Completed", with the designer's note) on frames and sections.
- **Comment threads**, open and resolved, each placed on the layer its pin points at. Figma pins comments to a frame plus an offset, so the thread goes to the deepest container under the pin. Comments need the token's Comments read scope (`file_comments:read`); without it the output carries a note and the design still comes back.
- **MCP SDK 1.32.2** instead of upstream's exact pin of 1.29.0, which has known advisories in its HTTP and OAuth code. The private `validateToolInput` method that `src/mcp/validation-capture.ts` patches is still there.
- **Released on GitHub, not npm.** Each `vX.Y.Z` tag attaches the package tarball to a [release](https://github.com/andyfo/Figma-Context-MCP/releases). Install it by URL so your lockfile pins its sha512:

  ```bash
  npm install https://github.com/andyfo/Figma-Context-MCP/releases/download/v1.0.1/godmode-figma-mcp-1.0.1.tgz
  ```

Our changes stay as separate commits on top of upstream, so each upstream release can be rebased onto.

Give [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) and other AI-powered coding tools access to your Figma files with this [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server.

When Cursor has access to Figma design data, it's **way** better at one-shotting designs accurately than alternative approaches like pasting screenshots.

<h3><a href="https://www.framelink.ai/docs/quickstart?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=readme">See quickstart instructions →</a></h3>

## Demo

## How it works

1. Open your IDE's chat (e.g. agent mode in Cursor).
2. Paste a link to a Figma file, frame, or group.
3. Ask Cursor to do something with the Figma file—e.g. implement the design.
4. Cursor will fetch the relevant metadata from Figma and use it to write your code.

This MCP server is specifically designed for use with Cursor. Before responding with context from the [Figma API](https://www.figma.com/developers/api), it simplifies and translates the response so only the most relevant layout and styling information is provided to the model.

Reducing the amount of context provided to the model helps make the AI more accurate and the responses more relevant.

## Getting Started

Many code editors and other AI clients use a configuration file to manage MCP servers.

The `figma-developer-mcp` server can be configured by adding the following to your configuration file.

> NOTE: You will need to create a Figma access token to use this server. Instructions on how to create a Figma API access token can be found [here](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/8085703771159-Manage-personal-access-tokens).

### MacOS / Linux

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Framelink MCP for Figma": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "figma-developer-mcp", "--figma-api-key=YOUR-KEY", "--stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Windows

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Framelink MCP for Figma": {
      "command": "cmd",
      "args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "figma-developer-mcp", "--figma-api-key=YOUR-KEY", "--stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

Or you can set `FIGMA_API_KEY` and `PORT` in the `env` field.

If you need more information on how to configure the Framelink MCP for Figma, see the [Framelink docs](https://www.framelink.ai/docs/quickstart?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=readme).
